Module "RTI1"      (bean Init_RTI_HCS08)
   - RTI1_Init -This method initializes registers of the RTI module according to this Peripheral Initialization Bean settings. 
                Call this method in the user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE 
                automatically; see "Call Init method" property of the bean for more details.

Module "SWI"       (bean InterruptVector)

Module "MC13191IRQ" (bean InterruptVector)

Module "PWM_XBee"  (bean Init_TPM_HCS08)
   - PWM_XBee_Init -This method initializes registers of the TPM module according to this Peripheral Initialization Bean 
                settings. Call this method in the user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE 
                automatically; see "Call Init method" property of the bean for more details.

Module "AudioOut"  (bean InterruptVector)

Module "KBI"       (bean Init_KBI_HCS08)
   - KBI_Init -This method initializes registers of the KBI module according to this Peripheral Initialization Bean settings. 
                Call this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; 
                see "Call Init method" property of the bean for more details.

Module "ADC1"      (bean Init_ADC_HCS08)
   - ADC1_Init -This method initializes registers of the ADC module according to this Peripheral Initialization Bean settings. 
                Call this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; 
                see "Call Init method" property of the bean for more details.

Module "Cpu"       (bean MC9S08GT60_44)
   - Cpu_SetHighSpeed -Sets the high speed mode. The method is enabled only if low or slow speed mode is enabled in the bean as 
                well.
   - Cpu_SetSlowSpeed -Sets the slow speed mode. The method is enabled only if slow speed mode is enabled in the bean.
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_Delay100US -This method realizes software delay. The length of delay is at least 100 microsecond multiply input 
                parameter [us100]. As the delay implementation is not based on real clock, the delay time may be increased by 
                interrupt service routines processed during the delay. The method is independent on selected speed mode.
