Module "RTI1"      (bean Init_RTI_HCS08)
   - RTI1_Init -This method initializes registers of the RTI module according to this Peripheral Initialization Bean settings. 
                Call this method in the user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE 
                automatically; see "Call Init method" property of the bean for more details.

Module "SWI"       (bean InterruptVector)

Module "MC13191IRQ" (bean InterruptVector)

Module "USB"       (bean AsynchroSerial)
   - USB_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the bean is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar method 
                only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be stored. 
                Enabling the bean (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is available only if 
                the transmitter property is enabled.  Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:
                If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured to use DMA controller then 
                this method only sets selected DMA channel. Then the status of the DMA transfer can be checked using 
                GetCharsInTxBuf method. See an example of a typical usage for details about communication using DMA.
   - USB_RecvBlock -If any data is received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental error), 
                otherwise it returns an error code (it does not wait for data).  This method is available only if non-zero 
                length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter is set to 
                the number of received characters. Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  
                If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the receiver is configured to use DMA controller then 
                this method only sets the selected DMA channel. Then the status of the DMA transfer can be checked using 
                GetCharsInRxBuf method. See an example of a typical usage for details about communication using DMA.
   - USB_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output 
                buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.  Version specific information for Freescale 56800 
                derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured 
                to use DMA controller then this method only sets the selected DMA channel. Then the status of the DMA transfer 
                can be checked using GetCharsInTxBuf method. See typical usage for details about communication using DMA.
   - USB_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled. Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA 
                controller is available on the selected CPU and the receiver is configured to use DMA controller then this 
                method returns the number of characters in the receive buffer.
   - USB_GetError -Returns a set of errors on the channel (errors that cannot be returned by given methods). The errors 
                accumulate in a set; after calling [GetError] this set is returned and cleared.

Module "Cpu"       (bean MC13213)
   - Cpu_SetHighSpeed -Sets the high speed mode. The method is enabled only if low or slow speed mode is enabled in the bean as 
                well.
   - Cpu_SetSlowSpeed -Sets the slow speed mode. The method is enabled only if slow speed mode is enabled in the bean.
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_Delay100US -This method realizes software delay. The length of delay is at least 100 microsecond multiply input 
                parameter [us100]. As the delay implementation is not based on real clock, the delay time may be increased by 
                interrupt service routines processed during the delay. The method is independent on selected speed mode.
