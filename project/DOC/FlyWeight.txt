Module "TickTimer" (bean TimerInt)
   - TickTimer_Enable -Enables the bean - it starts the timer. Events may be generated ("DisableEvent"/"EnableEvent").
   - TickTimer_SetFreqHz -This method sets the new frequency of the generated events. The frequency is expressed in [Hz] as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. This method is available only if the runtime setting type 'from interval' is 
                selected in the <Timing dialog box> in the Runtime setting area.

Module "SW1Int"    (bean ExtInt)
   - SW1Int_Enable -Enable the bean - the external events are accepted.

Module "SWI"       (bean InterruptVector)

Module "AudioOut"  (bean PWM)
   - AudioOut_SetRatio16 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as a 16-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - 
                FFFF value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%.  Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer possibilities and on 
                the selected period.

Module "Cpu"       (bean MC9S08GT60_44)
   - Cpu_SetHighSpeed -Sets the high speed mode. The method is enabled only if low or slow speed mode is enabled in the bean as 
                well.
   - Cpu_SetLowSpeed -Sets the low speed mode. The method is enabled only if low speed mode is enabled in the bean.
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables maskable interrupts
